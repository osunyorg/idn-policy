    <p>Policy Objective - Who Controls Technology, Controls the Future  <br>   <br>Right now, technology isn’t built for people—it’s built for profit. 🏭 Corporations patent life-saving medicine and block cheaper alternatives. 🛰 Surveillance tech grows while communities have no say over how it’s used. 🔥 Climate ""solutions"" like geoengineering are pushed by billionaires while real, community-led responses are ignored. 🚫 We shouldn’t have to rely on Google, Amazon, or Elon Musk for innovation. ✅ Technology should serve public good—not corporate monopolies or military expansion.</p>  <p> Science & Tech Policy Instruments 👇  <br>   <br>Remember: Policy instruments are the means by which governments can achieve the degrowth goals/objectives we urgently need!</p>  <p> 1 - Reassess the Role of Technology – Not All "Solutions" Are Real Solutions 💻  <br>   <br>💡  Translation:  Just because something is high-tech doesn’t mean it’s a good idea. 🌞 Solar radiation management? Could disrupt global weather patterns and disempower communities. 🏭 Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)? Could mean mass deforestation to grow biofuel crops, worsening land grabs. 🌲 Reforestation? Only if it’s diverse, regenerative, and locally controlled. No more planting endless rows of monoculture trees that kill biodiversity. 📌 How this policy seeks to address this 🤖 No tech deployment without strict ecological & social criteria. 👥 Tech must support community resilience—not corporate control. 💥 Not every technological ""fix"" is actually a fix. Some just shift the problem elsewhere.</p>  <p> 2 - Reduce Patent Monopolies – Knowledge Belongs to Everyone 🧑‍🤝‍🧑  <br>   <br>💡  Translation:  Stop letting corporations "own" technology that should be public. Right now, corporations patent medicine, seeds, renewable tech, and digital tools—blocking access and innovation. 🚫 The problem? 💊 Pharmaceutical companies patent drugs that should be available to all. 🔋 Big Tech hoards renewable energy patents instead of making them open-source. 💰 Startups exist just to buy and sit on patents, killing innovation. 📌 How this policy seeks to address this ⚙️ Limit patent duration—so innovation isn’t locked up forever. 🌐 Expand open-source tech—so knowledge spreads freely. ⚛ Make essential medicines, green tech, and social infrastructure patent-free. 💥 No one should die or go without because a corporation ""owns"" a cure or a tool."</p>  <p> 3 - Reorient Tech & Science – No More Weapons & Surveillance, More Public Good 📹  <br>   <br>💡  Translation:  Fund science that helps people, not arms dealers. Right now, billions are spent on: 🛡 Military research (because war is profitable). 🏢 Luxury tech (because Silicon Valley loves making things for the rich). 📡 Mass surveillance (because governments and corporations love control). 🚫 The problem? 💣 We invest in making better bombs, but not in fixing housing crises. 📱 We get new iPhones every year, but no innovation in repairing old ones. 📊 We monitor people’s data, but don’t track corporate environmental destruction. 📌 How this policy seeks to address this 🔬 Redirect science funding toward climate resilience, care work, and social infrastructure. 📢 Ban public funding for tech that fuels war, surveillance, or corporate expansion. ⚡ Make tech accountable to the public, not just to profit-driven investors. 💥 If technology isn’t making life better for people and the planet, it’s not progress—it’s just power hoarding.</p>
