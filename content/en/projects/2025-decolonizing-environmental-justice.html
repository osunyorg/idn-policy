    <p>Policy Objective   <br> Energy & Environment Policy Instruments 👇  <br>   <br>Remember: Policy instruments are the means by which governments can achieve the degrowth goals/objectives we urgently need!</p>  <p> 1 - Decolonise land, resources, and governance 🗻  <br>   <br>💡  Translation: Climate justice starts with land back, reparations, and dismantling corporate and military control. 🏞 Return stolen land and recognise Indigenous and frontline communities as primary stewards of ecosystems. 🛑 Ban extractive industries (logging, mining, oil drilling) from Indigenous and occupied lands without consent. 🌍 End neocolonial ‘green’ solutions like carbon offset schemes, debt-driven climate finance, and corporate-controlled conservation projects. 💰 Ensure climate reparations and resource redistribution so Global South nations and frontline communities have the power to shape their own futures. 🏴 Dismantle corporate and military control over natural resources, prioritising community-led and cooperative energy and land management. 💥 There is no climate justice without decolonization.</p>
