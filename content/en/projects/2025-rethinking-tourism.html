The profits from tourism flow to a handful of corporations while locals get underpaid, precarious jobs.Landlords and investors drive out residents. Short-term rentals and luxury developments push out the people who actually live there.The community has no say—decisions are made based on profit, not local well-being.📌 How this policy seeks to address this🏡 Local co-ops own hotels, restaurants, and tour businesses—so money stays in the community.💰 Tourism profits are reinvested in public services, housing, and conservation instead of disappearing into corporate bank accounts.🗳 Decisions about tourism are made by the people who live there—not by hotel chains, airlines, or international investors.💥 Tourism should serve the people who host it—not exploit them.</p>  <p> 2 - Prioritise the Right to Live Over the Right to Travel 🛌🏽  <br>   <br>💡 Translation: Tourism is a privilege, not a human right.The UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has actually proposed making tourism a human right. Let’s be real:🚫 This is not about human rights. It’s about guaranteeing the right of wealthy travelers to roam freely, while many can’t even afford housing or basic security.📌 How this policy seeks to address this- Redefine tourism as a voluntary act of hosting, not an automatic entitlement.- Communities should have the power to say no to destructive tourism.- The well-being of residents, refugees, and ecosystems should come first—not the convenience of travelers.- Fight the idea that tourism = economic necessity.- Tourism should be one option among many, not a forced industry that replaces real, sustainable local economies.- Tax the ultra-rich for their excessive travel.- The wealthiest fly more, cruise more, and consume more resources—they should pay for the damage.💥 No one has the “right” to a cheap holiday at the expense of someone else’s home.</p>
