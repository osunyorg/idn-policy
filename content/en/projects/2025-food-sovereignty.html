    <p>Policy Objective 1 - Food systems by and for the people  <br>   <br>Food sovereignty means local communities, not corporations or trade agreements, control their food. This policy ensures that food production prioritises local needs over export profits.</p>  <p> Food Policy Instruments 👇  <br>   <br>Remember: Policy instruments are the means by which governments can achieve the degrowth goals/objectives we urgently need!</p>  <p> 1 - Develop local food networks 🍓  <br>   <br>💡  Translation:  Keep food production and consumption close together. 🏛 Mandate state institutions (schools, hospitals, government offices) to buy local. 🚜 Shorten supply chains and strengthen municipal food markets. 🏡 Encourage food co-ops, CSAs, and local food councils. 📍 Label food miles and introduce food taxes that reflect environmental costs.</p>  <p> Policy Objective 2 - Promote seed sharing  <br> 1 - Promote seed sharing and local seed banks 🌱  <br>   <br>💡  Translation:  No more corporate control over seeds—restore biodiversity. 🌾 Establish community and regional seed banks to preserve local crops. 🎉 Organise seed-sharing festivals and networks. 🚫 Resist corporate patents on seeds and genetic modification monopolies.</p>  <p> Policy Objective 3 - Rebuild soil fertility  <br> 1 - Restore soil fertility through local organic matter systems 🌻  <br>   <br>Restore soil fertility through local organic matter systems <br>💡  Translation: Soil health should come from nature, not synthetic chemicals. 💩 Establish networks of manure storage facilities to ensure organic fertilisers are available and accessible to local farmers. 🍂 Develop local organic matter banks to redistribute compost, crop residues, and animal manure, supporting nutrient-rich soil without reliance on synthetic inputs. 🚜 Encourage community-led composting initiatives that return food and farm waste to the soil. 🏡 Support policies that require municipalities to integrate food scrap collection with local composting and soil restoration efforts. 🌱 Invest in training programmes to help farmers transition to regenerative soil practices, such as crop rotation, cover cropping, and agroecological techniques. 💥 Healthy soil is the foundation of food sovereignty—without it, we’re just renting fertility from corporations.</p>  <p> Policy Objective 4 - Land distribution to peasants and/or landless  <br> 1 - Legislate for land redistribution 👩🏿‍🌾  <br>   <br>Restore soil fertility through local organic matter systems <br>💡  Translation:  Land should serve those who work it, not absentee landlords or agribusiness. 🏞 Advocate for policies that grant small farmers and indigenous peoples access to land. ⚖️ Break up large landholdings and monopolies on agricultural land. 🌱 Prioritise regenerative and cooperative land management.</p>
