    <p>Policy Objective   <br>   <br>Right now, tourism is sold as an economic miracle—but who actually benefits?🏝 Entire coastlines are swallowed by resorts while locals are priced out of their own towns.✈️ Airlines burn through more carbon than some entire countries.🛳 Cruise ships dump sewage straight into the ocean while their billionaire owners dodge taxes.Tourism shouldn’t be about infinite growth and luxury for the few at the expense of communities and ecosystems. Instead, it should increase well-being without driving environmental destruction or social inequality.🚫 We’re done with extractive, elite-driven tourism.✅ Time to make travel about connection, not consumption.</p>  <p> Tourism Policy Instruments 👇  <br>   <br>Remember: Policy instruments are the means by which governments can achieve the degrowth goals/objectives we urgently need!</p>  <p> 1 - Limit Fossil-Fuel-Based Travel – No More Climate-Wrecking Holidays ✈️  <br>   <br>💡 Translation: Your weekend getaway shouldn’t burn as much fuel as a small town does in a year.Tourism today relies on massive fossil fuel consumption. We hop on cheap flights, cruise ships act like floating cities of waste, and the planet foots the bill.🚫 The problem?✈️ Flying is one of the most carbon-intensive things an individual can do.🛳 Cruise ships burn more fuel per passenger than thousands of cars—while polluting the ocean and employing slaves (yes), from the Global South.🏝 Some places are completely overrun with tourists, pushing out locals and devastating ecosystems.📌 How this policy seeks to address this🌍 Make tourists pay the full environmental cost of their travel.- Tax flights progressively based on distance—fly farther, pay more.- Cruise ship restrictions & taxation on ship size—because mega-cruises are floating disasters.- Reduce tourism in fragile ecosystems—no more mass tourism swamping Venice, the Maldives, or coral reefs.The idea? If people must travel, they should do it consciously, thoughtfully, and without wrecking entire regions.</p>  <p> 2 - Slow & Sustainable Tourism – Make Travel Meaningful Again ⛵  <br>   <br>💡 Translation: Travel should be about real experiences, not just ticking off Instagram spots.Tourism today is about speed, status, and consuming as many experiences as possible.🚀 Weekend in Paris, next week Thailand, then off to Mexico.📸 Pack in a hundred “must-sees,” barely scratch the surface, fly home exhausted.💰 Luxury resorts cater to the rich while locals work unstable, low-paid tourism jobs.📌 How this policy seeks to address this🚂 Promote slower, regional travel—trains over planes, bikes over cars.🏡 Stay in locally-owned places instead of massive hotel chains, or couchsurf.🥘 Encourage deeper cultural experiences—food, music, nature—not just quick sightseeing.🛑 Reframe travel as a privilege, not a right—because “cheap” flights aren’t cheap when the planet is paying for them.🌱 Travel less, stay longer, and actually connect with the places you visit and the people you meet in them.</p>  <p> 3 - Moratorium on New Tourism Developments – Stop the Concrete Takeover 🏨  <br>   <br>💡 Translation: No more resorts swallowing entire coastlines and forests.Tourism developers love to bulldoze ecosystems and communities to make way for hotels, theme parks, and luxury rentals. They also love to drop concrete next to a forest and then call themselves eco resorts...🚫 The problem?🏗 Mega-resorts displace communities and destroy landscapes.💦 Hotels drain local water supplies, leaving residents with shortages.🏝 Sacred and protected lands get privatized for wealthy tourists.📌 How this policy seeks to address this⏸ Temporary bans on new tourism projects in fragile areas.🔎 Impact assessments before any new developments—putting communities, not corporations, in control.🏛 Reclaim public space—no more private beaches owned by hotels while locals are fenced out.💥 Tourism should enhance places, not exploit them.</p>
