    <p>Policy Objective   <br>   <br>🤚 Teaching the value of “enough" Modern cultures promote GROWTH, the more, the faster, the bigger—but a truly functional and sustainable society should value sufficiency over accumulation. This policy integrates the ethics of ""enough"" into education and community spaces.</p>  <p> Culture & Education Policy Instruments 👇  <br>   <br>Remember: Policy instruments are the means by which governments can achieve the degrowth goals/objectives we urgently need!</p>  <p> 1 - Sustainable lifestyle education – learning how to live well, simply, and within the planet's limits 🌍  <br>   <br>💡  Translation:  Teach practical sufficiency—not just theory. 🏡 Minimalism, low-impact living, slow food, and eco-masculinities should all be part of the sufficiency curriculum. 🌍 Instead of promoting consumerism, education should demonstrate practical ways to live well with less. 📖 Students learn about alternative ways of organizing life, from degrowth communities to post-consumerist cultures.</p>  <p> 2 - Community-oriented learning spaces – schools as hubs for sufficiency 🏫  <br>   <br>💡  Translation:  Education is about more than individual success—its about building collective resilience. 🌱 Transform schools into sustainability hubs—think school gardens, community farms, skill-sharing, and repair workshops. 🏡 Create learning environments where knowledge flows between students, elders, and local practitioners. 🔄 Instead of isolating schools from communities, integrate them into the social fabric of local communities.</p>
