    <p>Policy Objective   <br>   <br>Right now, the finance world is a casino for the ultra-rich, where money moves around in ways that create nothing of real value. The system rewards: 📈 Short-term speculation – billionaires profit off stock market fluctuations while economies crash. 💰 Debt-based money – banks make money out of thin air and charge people interest for it. 🏦 Hoarding over sharing – cash sits in offshore accounts while communities struggle. 🚫 Finance is supposed to serve society as a whole, not speculating and gambling. ✅ This policy shifts money towards ethical, sustainable, and non-exploitative finance.</p>  <p> Finance Policy Instruments 👇  <br>   <br>Remember: Policy instruments are the means by which governments can achieve the degrowth goals/objectives we urgently need!</p>  <p> 1 - Support Non-Speculative Currencies & Exchange Systems – Money Without Middlemen 💹  <br>   <br>💡  Translation:   Why rely on banks when we can create better ways to exchange value? The current system is built on debt, interest, and profit-driven finance, all of which concentrate wealth and suck resources out of communities. 🚫 The problem? 💰 Banks and corporations control money flow, deciding who gets credit and at what cost. 📉 Speculative currencies (like crypto) mostly serve wealthy investors, not communities. 💳 Everything is debt-based—meaning the system only works if people stay in debt. 🔄  How this policy seeks to address this: 🌱 Promote local currencies – money that stays within communities instead of being extracted by global banks. ⏳ Expand time banks – where people exchange skills/services without money or profit motives. 💡 Encourage cooperative finance – community-owned funds that invest in real needs, not market speculation. 💥 Money should serve communities, not financial empires.</p>  <p> 2 - Encourage Socially Responsible Investing – Finance That Supports Life, Not Speculation 💚  <br>   <br>💡  Translation:  Invest in things that actually matter, not stocks and schemes. Right now, money fuels destruction because investors chase the highest returns, regardless of consequences. 🚫 The problem? 🌍 Finance flows into fossil fuels, real estate speculation, and corporate expansion. 💵 Short-term, high-profit investments dominate, while long-term sustainability is ignored. 🏛 Public money (like pension funds) gets used for destructive investments instead of social good. 🔄 How this policy seeks to addresses this: 🌿 Investment in ecological restoration, small-scale renewables, and community resilience. 🏥 Support care work and public services instead of speculative assets. 📜 A Green New Deal without growth – meaning real sustainability, not so-called ""green capitalism"". 💥 Finance should fund well-being, not endless accumulation.</p>
