    <p>Policy Objective - Unrig trade  <br>   <br>Trade isn’t neutral—it’s a system designed by the most powerful economies to keep their dominance intact. - Rich countries set the rules, while Global South nations are forced to play along. - Trade agreements protect corporate profits over human rights, blocking environmental protections and fair wages. - The Global North floods markets with subsidized food and products, wrecking local economies elsewhere. 🚫 This isn't a free market—it’s a rigged market. ✅ This policy is about un-rigging it.</p>  <p> Trade Policy Instruments 👇  <br>   <br>Remember: Policy instruments are the means by which governments can achieve the degrowth goals/objectives we urgently need!</p>  <p> 1 - Renegotiate Trade Agreements – No More Backroom Deals 🤝  <br>   <br>💡  Translation:  Rewrite the rules so trade works for everyone, not just the Global North. Right now, trade agreements protect corporate interests, not people or the planet. They allow companies to sue governments if they introduce environmental laws that hurt profits. (Yes, really.) Agricultural subsidies in the Global North flood markets with cheap food, bankrupting small farmers elsewhere. 🚜 Example: The EU and US subsidize their farmers so much that they can export food cheaper than local farmers can even grow it in places like West Africa. That’s not “competition”—that’s economic sabotage. 📌 How this policy seeks to address this 🌱 Trade agreements should prioritize sustainability, labor rights, and economic fairness—not just corporate profit margins. 🌍 Global South countries should have equal negotiating power—instead of being forced into bad deals. 🚜 Agricultural subsidies in the Global North should be reformed so they don’t wipe out small-scale farmers elsewhere. 💥 Trade should work for people, not corporate boardrooms.</p>  <p> 2 - Ease Intellectual Property Rights – Knowledge Belongs to the Many, Not the Few 🧠  <br>   <br>💡  Translation:  No more billion-dollar patents on life-saving medicine and green technology. - Right now, big corporations hoard knowledge under strict intellectual property laws, stopping life-saving tech, among other things from being shared. - Pharmaceutical companies patent essential medicines, blocking cheaper alternatives from being made. - Western firms lock up green technology so poorer nations can’t access it without paying through the nose. 🏥 Examples : - The COVID-19 vaccine could have been shared widely and freely, but pharmaceutical companies refused—so the richest countries got vaccinated first, while poorer nations waited years - some still have not received their first shot. - Farmers in the Global South are forced to pay for patented seeds from companies like Monsanto, even when traditional crops could work just fine. 📌 How this policy seeks to address this 📖 Commonify patents—treat vital knowledge, medicine, and green tech as a shared global good, not a corporate asset. ⚡ Open-source sustainable tech so countries can actually transition to renewables without being blocked by patents. 💊 Make life-saving medicine freely available—because no one should die so a corporation can maximize profits. 💥 Knowledge should be for humanity, not locked behind a corporate paywall. What good is it if it isn't making the world a better place for all, and most importantly the oppressed and poorest?</p>
