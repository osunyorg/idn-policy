    Indicators – Ditch GDP and Measure What Matters Or: Why Should We Celebrate Growth If It’s Just Making Life Worse?
  summary: >-
    <p>  Redefining Progress Beyond GDP<br>Right now, governments obsess over GDP growth like it's the only thing that matters. But what does GDP actually measure? Essentially, GDP is a measure of monetary transactions in society. The assumption of economics is that if more money floats around the world gets better. Below is a few examples of why this is not the case:<br><br>🌍 More oil spills = GDP goes up (because cleanup costs money).<br>💊 More sick people = GDP goes up (because of medical bills).<br>🏦 More financial speculation = GDP goes up (even if it's just rich people making money off money).<br>🚫 GDP doesn't measure well-being. It doesn't measure justice. It doesn't measure sustainability. It doesn't measure care work. $1000 of healthcare and $1000 of arm sales to Israel for the genocide in Palestine are the same thing as far as GDP is concerned. <br>✅ This policy is about ditching GDP and using indicators that actually reflect social and ecological health.  </p>
