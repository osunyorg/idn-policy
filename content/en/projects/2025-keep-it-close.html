    <p>Objective  <br>   <br>Right now, we fly avocados around the world like they’re rockstars on a world tour, ship plastic toys across entire oceans, and truck bottled water thousands of miles when there’s tap water right there. This isn’t just ridiculous—it’s wrecking the planet, and exploiting many many humans.The goal here is to cut down on wasteful, long-haul trade, shrink those excessively long supply chains, and build stronger local economies where stuff is made and sold closer to home. This means less pollution, fewer and eventually no exploited workers, and more resilient communities that aren’t dependent on a few mega-corporations shipping everything from the other side of the world.</p>  <p> Instruments  <br> Export Quotas – Keep Resources for the People Who Need Them  <br>Translation: Stop treating local production like a corporate giveaway.Right now, resources and food flow to the highest bidder, not where they’re needed. Example: Countries in the Global South export tons of food while their own people go hungry.Solution? Put limits on what gets exported so basic needs come first, not corporate profits. If a country grows wheat, its people should eat wheat before corporations sell it off overseas. And let’s cut down unnecessary transport—especially aviation. No more flying fruit across the planet while local farmers struggle.</p>  <p> Ditch Truck Convoys – Move Freight to Rail & Local Transport  <br>Translation: Highways shouldn’t be clogged with trucks moving nonsense.Right now, our cities are crammed with trucks moving goods that could be produced locally. Rail is faster, cleaner, and doesn’t turn roads into traffic nightmares. Ports shouldn’t just be giant corporate shipping hubs—they should be community-controlled, with power to limit ship traffic. Last-mile delivery? Cargo bikes, not Amazon vans.  Freight? Rail, not highways. The fewer fossil-fuel trucks and container ships we rely on, the less we let corporations dictate trade.</p>  <p> Shorter Supply Chains  <br>Why should your food and clothes have a bigger carbon footprint than you?The problem? A lot of what we buy travels insane distances before reaching us. Think about it: Your shirt might be made in Vietnam, stitched in Bangladesh, dyed in China, and sold in Europe. Your lettuce might be grown in Spain, packed in Poland, and trucked to your local store in Denmark.Why? Because it’s 'cheaper'. But only if you ignore the CO2, waste, and exploited workers. And this is all so companies can chase the lowest wages.</p>  <p> How this policy seeks to address this  <br>   <br>Bring production back to communities. Make it easier, cheaper, and more logical to produce and buy locally.🍞 Food is grown where it’s eaten. Support local farmers.👕 Clothes are made by workers who aren’t underpaid and overworked.🔧 Basic goods are produced regionally, not trucked across continents.🛒 Encourage businesses to source regionally instead of chasing the lowest wages globally.</p>  <p> What changes?  </p>
