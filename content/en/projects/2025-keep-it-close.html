    <p>Objective  <br>   <br>Right now, we fly avocados around the world like they’re rockstars on a world tour, ship plastic toys across entire oceans, and truck bottled water thousands of miles when there’s tap water right there. This isn’t just ridiculous—it’s wrecking the planet, and exploiting many many humans.The goal here is to cut down on wasteful, long-haul trade, shrink those excessively long supply chains, and build stronger local economies where stuff is made and sold closer to home. This means less pollution, fewer and eventually no exploited workers, and more resilient communities that aren’t dependent on a few mega-corporations shipping everything from the other side of the world.</p>  <p> Instruments  <br> Export Quotas – Keep Resources for the People Who Need Them  <br> (Translation: Stop treating local production like a corporate giveaway.)Right now, resources and food flow to the highest bidder, not where they’re needed. Example: Countries in the Global South export tons of food while their own people go hungry.Solution? Put limits on what gets exported so basic needs come first, not corporate profits. If a country grows wheat, its people should eat wheat before corporations sell it off overseas. And let’s cut down unnecessary transport—especially aviation. No more flying fruit across the planet while local farmers struggle.</p>
